## Overview

Each data source and level of aggregation has a separate CSV, named using the following convention: *Data source* – *Geographic Level of Aggregation* – *Temporal Level of Aggregation*

Additionally, we have three files, **GeoIDs – State** and **GeoIDs – County** and **GeoIDs – City**, that provide information on geographic crosswalks and aggregation. These can be merged to any file sharing the same geographic level of aggregation using the geographic identifier. Additionally, **GeoIDs – County** indicates the commuting zone (CZ) and state that each county belongs to. The City-level data (listed under "Metro" on the tracker site) associates the largest cities in the United States with a representative county one-to-one (except in the case of New York City which includes the 5 boroughs).

Finally, we have gathered a collection of key state-level policy dates relevant for changes in other series trends and values. These are contained in the **Policy Milestones – State** file.

A description of the columns in each file follows.

All spending variables are measured relative to January 6 to February 2, 2020, seasonally adjusted, and calculated as a 7 day moving average. When we subdivide by income using the median income of the ZIP codes, `q1` is the quartile with the lowest median income and `q4` is the quartile with the highest median income. At the national level, we release a variety of breakdowns *without seasonal adjustment* in variables that begin with `spend_s_` (relative to January 2019 for 2019 data, relative to January 2020 for 2020 data onward) or `spend_19_` (relative to Janurary 7 to February 3, 2019 for all data) instead of `spend_`. 

The merchant category codes (MCC) making up the grouped spending categories are:

* **Retail spending:** CLO clothing and clothing accessories; BLD building materials, garden equipment, and supplies; ELC electronics and appliances; FBS food and beverage stores; FUR furniture and home furnishings; GEN general merchandise stores; and SPO sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments, and book stores.
* **Durable goods:** BLD building materials, gardening equipment, and supplies; ELC electronics and appliances; FUR furniture and home furnishings; SPO sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments, and bookstores; TEL telecommunications; and VEH motor vehicles and parts.
* **Non-durable goods:** CLO clothing and clothing accessories; FBS food and beverage stores; GAS gasoline stations; GEN general merchandise; HPC health and personal care stores; and WHO wholesale trade.
* **Remote services:** ADM administrative and support and waste management and remediation services; EDU education; FIN finance and insurance; INF information; PST professional, scientific, and technical; PUB public administration; and UCM utilities, construction, and manufacturing.
* **In-person services:** ACF accomodation and food services; HCS healthcare and social assistance; AER arts, entertainment, and recreation; TWS transportation and warehousing; REN rental and leasing; REP repair and maintenance; and PLS personal and laundry services.

Note that for every variable listed here, there is a corresponding variable with the prefix `break_` (for example, `break_engagement`). During the period in which schools are on summer or winter break, we record the outcomes in these `break_` variables instead of the usual variables. These numbers are not displayed on the [Economic Tracker](https://tracktherecovery.org) because they do not reliably measure differences in student learning across geography and income groups when many schools are on break.

To ensure privacy, the results for some counties are masked. Where possible, masked county levels values are replaced by commuting zone means, as indicated by the `imputed_from_cz` variable. The masking criteria are explained in further detail in our [data documentation](https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/blob/main/docs/oi_tracker_data_documentation.md#online-math-participation).
