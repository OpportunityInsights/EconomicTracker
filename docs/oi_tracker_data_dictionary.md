<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Each data source and level of aggregation has a separate CSV, named using the following convention: <em>Data source</em> – <em>Geographic Level of Aggregation</em> – <em>Temporal Level of Aggregation</em></p>
<p>Additionally, we have three files, <strong>GeoIDs – State</strong> and <strong>GeoIDs – County</strong> and <strong>GeoIDs – City</strong>, that provide information on geographic crosswalks and aggregation. These can be merged to any file sharing the same geographic level of aggregation using the geographic identifier. Additionally, <strong>GeoIDs – County</strong> indicates the commuting zone (CZ) and state that each county belongs to. The City-level data (listed under “Metro” on the tracker site) associates the largest cities in the United States with a representative county one-to-one (except in the case of New York City which includes the 5 boroughs).</p>
<p>Finally, we have gathered a collection of key state-level policy dates relevant for changes in other series trends and values. These are contained in the <strong>Policy Milestones – State</strong> file.</p>
<p>A description of the columns in each file follows.</p>

<p>All spending variables are measured relative to January 6 to February 2, 2020, seasonally adjusted, and calculated as a 7 day moving average. When we subdivide by income using the median income of the ZIP codes, <code>q1</code> is the quartile with the lowest median income and <code>q4</code> is the quartile with the highest median income. At the national level, we release a variety of breakdowns <em>without seasonal adjustment</em> in variables that begin with <code>spend_s_</code> (relative to January 2019 for 2019 data, relative to January 2020 for 2020 data onward) or <code>spend_19_</code> (relative to Janurary 7 to February 3, 2019 for all data) instead of <code>spend_</code>.</p>
<p>The merchant category codes (MCC) making up the grouped spending categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail spending:</strong> CLO clothing and clothing accessories; BLD building materials, garden equipment, and supplies; ELC electronics and appliances; FBS food and beverage stores; FUR furniture and home furnishings; GEN general merchandise stores; and SPO sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments, and book stores.</li>
<li><strong>Durable goods:</strong> BLD building materials, gardening equipment, and supplies; ELC electronics and appliances; FUR furniture and home furnishings; SPO sporting goods, hobbies, musical instruments, and bookstores; TEL telecommunications; and VEH motor vehicles and parts.</li>
<li><strong>Non-durable goods:</strong> CLO clothing and clothing accessories; FBS food and beverage stores; GAS gasoline stations; GEN general merchandise; HPC health and personal care stores; and WHO wholesale trade.</li>
<li><strong>Remote services:</strong> ADM administrative and support and waste management and remediation services; EDU education; FIN finance and insurance; INF information; PST professional, scientific, and technical; PUB public administration; and UCM utilities, construction, and manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>In-person services:</strong> ACF accomodation and food services; HCS healthcare and social assistance; AER arts, entertainment, and recreation; TWS transportation and warehousing; REN rental and leasing; REP repair and maintenance; and PLS personal and laundry services.</li>

<p>Note that for every variable listed here, there is a corresponding variable with the prefix <code>break_</code> (for example, <code>break_engagement</code>). During the period in which schools are on summer or winter break, we record the outcomes in these <code>break_</code> variables instead of the usual variables. These numbers are not displayed on the <a href="https://tracktherecovery.org">Economic Tracker</a> because they do not reliably measure differences in student learning across geography and income groups when many schools are on break.</p>
<p>To ensure privacy, the results for some counties are masked. Where possible, masked county levels values are replaced by commuting zone means, as indicated by the <code>imputed_from_cz</code> variable. The masking criteria are explained in further detail in our <a href="https://github.com/OpportunityInsights/EconomicTracker/blob/main/docs/oi_tracker_data_documentation.md#online-math-participation">data documentation</a>.</p>
